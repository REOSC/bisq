This is an exchange option
in which only Bitcoin operation is automated.

Everything else you have to do with your own hands, if you like it.
That is, you need to transfer and track the movement of altcoins by yourself, instead of the exchange itself simply making a request to the nearest node.

I think that I am not enough “qualified” to appreciate the beauty of this creation by great programmers who selflessly love the github.
